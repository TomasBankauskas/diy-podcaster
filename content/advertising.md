![About me](images/advertising.png)

## Here are the facts!

- I have two sponsors per show, one spot each.
- I charge $2,000 per spot.
- I create a custom midroll for you during the show that I nicely integrate into the final audio.
- You can provide some talking points if you wish, otherwise, I just riff. A tracking URL is recommended so you can track success.
- I use Simplecast hosting, which tells us what I get about 50,000 downloads of the show per week (150k a month)

## Intrested?

The spots are sold through Syndicate Ads, and they have a calendar of availability you can see and self-service booking right there!
